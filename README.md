# Introduction

Surfline is a tech company based in Huntington Beach, CA. Surfline offers a variety of services for surf forecasting. The purpose of this project is to take the existing surfline cameras and make them intelligent. For this project, we are using transfer learning to train a model to detect different directions of waves. When surfing, a surfer can take-off at the peak of a wave and carve to the left or right. By using computer vision, we could try to provide surfers with a summary of how the waves are behaving at a particular time. Some surfers prefer lefts, while others prefer rights and this summary could help the surfers have clear expectations.
